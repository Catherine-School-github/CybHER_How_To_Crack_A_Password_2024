# CybHER_How_To_Crack_A_Password_2024
Files needed to learn the very basics of password cracking in a safe and legal way
NOTE: You must have 'pikepdf' installed on your system in order to use the pdf_breaker.py program. 

Thank you to the people responsible for https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Passwords/Common-Credentials/10-million-password-list-top-1000000.txt that supplied the main password list used here. 
Censoring of the password file to make it as teaching appropriate as possible has happened, such as deleting passwords containing slurs, swears, drug usages, and other innapropriate content however it is almost certain many problamatic passwords had passed through the censor. 

DO NOT USE THESE PROGRAMS TO ACCESS CONTENT YOU ARE NOT LEAGALLY AND MORALLY ALLOWED TO. I take no responsibility for the use of this code for any illegal or immoral purposes, this code is here and public to inform individuals and use as a teaching supplement about the importance of having strong passwords in a safe and legal way using the files provided with this download.
